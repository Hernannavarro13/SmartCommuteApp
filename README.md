# SmartCommuteApp
Real-Time Traffic Alert App
Overview:
SmartCommute is a mobile app designed to help users avoid unexpected delays by analyzing real-time traffic and accident data before they leave for work or school. The app tracks a user's regular commute route and provides proactive notifications if delays or disruptions are detected—so users can leave earlier, take an alternate route, or avoid traffic stress altogether.

Key Features:

Commute Learning: Automatically learns your typical commute times and preferred routes.

Real-Time Alerts: Uses Google Maps Traffic and accident report APIs to detect significant delays or incidents.

Push Notifications: Sends timely alerts only when there's a meaningful delay, so you’re not bombarded with noise.

Alternate Route Suggestions: Provides faster route options with integrated map previews.

Schedule-Aware: Sends alerts only during your usual commute hours (e.g., 7:30–8:00 AM weekdays).

Clean, Minimal UI: Designed for quick glances, like checking the weather.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React Native

Backend: Node.js with Express

APIs: Google Maps Directions & Traffic API, Waze incident data (if accessible)

Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging

User Data: Firebase Firestore (real-time user route & preference storage)

Why It Matters:
With commuting being a daily task for millions, SmartCommute brings peace of mind by minimizing uncertainty and helping users make informed decisions before getting behind the wheel.
